## Hosting / Deployment

### ✅ Recommended: Streamlit Community Cloud
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and connect your GitHub account.
3. Click **New app** → select your fork, branch `main`, and `Code.py` as the file to run.
4. Click **Deploy** — your app will be public and automatically update on new commits.

Notes:
- If you need Google Drive integration, add the `client_secrets.json` contents to Streamlit **Secrets** (recommended) or upload it to the app root (use caution with sensitive files).

#### Streamlit Secrets (recommended)
In Streamlit Cloud, open your app settings → **Secrets** and add the following TOML to securely set admin credentials and Google Drive info.

Example:

```toml
# Admin credentials
[admin]
username = "your_admin_username"
password = "your_admin_password"

# Google Drive client secrets (as a JSON string) — paste the full client_secrets JSON here
[gdrive]
client_secrets = "{\"installed\": {\"client_id\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\", ... }}"
```

- The app will read `admin` and `gdrive.client_secrets` from `st.secrets` on startup and create the necessary `admin_config.json` and `client_secrets.json` files automatically.
- **Do not** commit `client_secrets.json` or `mycreds.txt` to the repository — they are ignored in `.gitignore` for security.

### Alternative: Render / Railway / Other
- Create a new web service, point it to this repository, select Python, and set the build command to `pip install -r requirements.txt` and start command to `streamlit run Code.py --server.port $PORT`.
- Ensure `runtime.txt` pins Python version (already included).

### Local Docker (optional)
- Build a container and run it behind a reverse proxy if required.
